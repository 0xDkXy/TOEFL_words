The Importance of Balance and Devotion in Accomplishment

In today's fast-paced world, it can be easy to lose sight of what's important. We are bombarded with information, acronyms, and tasks, and it's easy to become overwhelmed and careless. However, if we adhere to certain principles, we can maintain balance and achieve our goals. Here are some thoughts on a few of the key concepts that are essential to accomplishing our objectives.

Awareness and Investigation
One of the first steps in achieving any goal is to become aware of what we want to achieve. This requires investigation and interest in the subject matter. For example, if we want to renovate our home, we need to investigate what needs to be done, what materials are required, and how much it will cost. Similarly, if we want to improve our artistic abilities, we need to investigate different techniques and styles.

Curriculum and Doctrine
Once we have identified our goals, we need to create a curriculum or plan for achieving them. This may involve learning new skills, practicing regularly, or studying certain subjects. We also need to have a basic doctrine or set of principles that guide our actions. For example, if we want to become more honest, we need to have a doctrine that emphasizes honesty and integrity.

Striving and Devotion
Once we have a plan in place, we need to strive to achieve our goals. This requires devotion and a willingness to put in the time and effort necessary to succeed. For example, if we want to become more physically fit, we need to exercise regularly and adhere to a healthy diet. Similarly, if we want to become more successful in our careers, we need to put in the hours and effort required to achieve our objectives.

Balance and Surplus
However, while striving and devotion are important, it's also important to maintain balance in our lives. We need to make time for family and friends, for hobbies and relaxation, and for self-care. If we become too focused on our goals, we can become exhausted, stressed, and burnt out. Additionally, we need to be aware of any surplus we may have, such as time or money, and use it wisely.

Aggression and Dispute
Sometimes, in our pursuit of our goals, we may encounter aggression or dispute. This can come in the form of obstacles, disagreements with others, or unexpected challenges. It's important to address these issues calmly and sensually, without losing sight of our objectives. We may need to debate or negotiate with others, investigate alternative solutions, or seek professional assistance.

Collective and Council
Finally, it's important to remember that we are not alone in our pursuit of our goals. We can benefit from the support and wisdom of others. This may involve seeking advice or guidance from a mentor, participating in a collective or group, or consulting with a council or board.

In conclusion, accomplishing our goals requires a combination of awareness, investigation, curriculum, doctrine, striving, devotion, balance, surplus, addressing aggression and disputes, and seeking support from others. It may seem like a daunting task, but with the right mindset and approach, we can achieve great things. So, let's stretch ourselves and strive to be the best we can be, while also maintaining balance and enjoying life's pleasures along the way.
